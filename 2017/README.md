AOSCC 2017
==========

Welcome to our 4th annual community gathering, and this time in Guangzhou, from
July 14th to 16th!

AOSCC is your prime opportunity to meet our developers and friends online in
person. AOSCC is also a great chance for our developers to exhibit our
achievements and issues of the past year, and to discuss plans for the year
coming with community members; for friends of our community, it is also a great
platform to share their skills, opinions, and actions for free and/or open
source software.

Moreover, attendees could take part in our community projects' workshops to
gain hands-on experience with our development efforts.

Location
--------

AOSCC 2017's venue is generously sponsored by the

campus location at the H.E.M.C. (Higher Education Mega Center; 大学城).

The gathering will take place in Experiment Building 4, Room 304（实验四号楼 304

Transit
-------

It is quite easy to travel to and from H.E.M.C. with the Metro system - Line 2 and 4 both run through the H.E.M.C. South station which is within 300 metres of walking distance from our venue.

The Line 2 mostly serves as a East-West lane between the H.E.M.C., the southern districts, and the Guangzhou South Railway Station; Line 4 runs North-South from the southern border to the east urban area. That said, there
are some rules of thumbs for your convenience when travelling around
Guangzhou...

### CRH Trains

If travelling on CRH trains (dispatch numbers starting with C/D/G), you will probably arrive at...

The Guangzhou South Railway Station - take the Line 7 to the H.E.M.C. South station.

Lodging
-------

Lodging in Guangzhou could vary quite a bit in quality and price, but here's several economical choices we could recommend to you - eating in Guangzhou is a must, we have ranked those higher in relation to the ease of transit between the venue and the hotels.

Here below we have listed several of our recommendations based on its nearby facilities (transit and restaurant, though most listed below have easy access to restaurants and shopping facilities) offer approximated pricing on each.

TL;DR, when recommending these hotels, we prioritised heavily on public transit access (especially Metro), restaurants, affordability, and general safety (hence the heavy bias on chain hotels).

### Economic

These are hotel choices with pricing below CNY 300 per night (for two, or more if you wish; prices could be lower than listed below in July), mostly found along Line 2 and Line 4. Most of the ones listed below are within 1 hour of Metro ride from the venue...

The two recommended below are near the Chigang or Kecun station on Line 2 (transfer from Line 4... see the links to the maps below for more information), this location in Guangzhou offer relatively low prices on hotels - not to mention the vibrant dining and entertainment choices offered there.

The three below are found near the Tiyuxilu station on Line 3 or Tianhe Sports Centre station on Line 1 (again, see the maps for yourself), this is rougly the downtown area of Guangzhou, though prices could be higher when seeking food, the choices are quite numerous - ranging from Cantonese dimsum to North-Eastern style foods.

### Premium

If you do feel a bit charitable or on a vacational spirit, there are great choices around Tianhe Area, along Line 3 between the Tianhe Coach Terminal station and Canton Tower station. As very few would find the need for one, we are not going to list any below.

*"They should be quite easy to spot."*  
— Mingcong Bai

### Scenic

There are many great scenic locations along the new Haizhu Island Circular New Tram or Haizhu Tram 1. You could interchange with this line with Line 3 or the APM (Automated People Mover System) Line at Canton Tower station on these lines, or with Line 4 or 8 at Wanshengwei station.

Do search it up with a map though as prices could vary greatly depending on the location, generally the closer you get to the Canton Tower, the more expensive it gets - as Canton Tower signifies the start (or some would say the "central") to the CBD (Central Business District) area in Guangzhou.

### Airbnb?

Sure, there are many households who could rent short term in Guangzhou, but do look out for locations near Metro stations - it would make your life infinitely easier.
