AOSCC 2017
==========

Welcome to our 4th annual community gathering, and this time in Guangzhou!

AOSCC is your prime opportunity to meet our developers and friends online in
person. AOSCC is also a great chance for our developers to exhibit our
achievements and issues of the past year, and to discuss plans for the year
coming with community members; for friends of our community, it is also a great
platform to share their skills, opinions, and actions for free and/or open
source software.

Moreover, attendees could take part in our community projects' workshops to
gain hands-on experience with our development efforts.

Transit
-------

It is quite easy to travel to and from H.E.M.C. with the Metro system - Line 2 and 4 both run through the H.E.M.C. South station which is within 300 metres of walking distance from our venue.

The Line 2 mostly serves as a East-West lane between the H.E.M.C., the southern districts, and the Guangzhou South Railway Station; Line 4 runs North-South from the southern border to the east urban area. That said, there
are some rules of thumbs for your convenience when travelling around
Guangzhou...

- If travelling on CRH trains (dispatch numbers starting with C/D/G), you will probably arrive at the Guangzhou South Railway Station - take the Line 2 to the H.E.M.C. South station.
- If travelling on regular railway (dispatch numbers starting with K/T/Z), you will probably arrive at...
  - The Guangzhou Railway Station (or as most living in Guangzhou call the "old station") - take the Line 5, and interchange with Line 4 at Chebei South station, then get off at H.E.M.C. South station.
  - The Guangzhou East Railway Station - take the Line 1, and interchange with the Line 5 at Yangji station, then interchange with the Line 4 at Chebei South station, and finally get off at the H.E.M.C. South station.
- If travelling on airplanes, you will probably arrive at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport - take the Line 3 North Extension, interchange with Line 3 (normal) at Tiyuxilu Station, then interchange with Line 5 at Zhujiang New Town Station, then again, interchange with Line 4 at Chebei South Station, and finally, get off at the H.E.M.C. South station.

Lodging
-------

Lodging in Guangzhou could vary quite a bit in quality and price, but here's several economical choices we could recommend to you - eating in Guangzhou is a must, we have ranked those higher in relation to the ease of transit between the venue and the hotels.
