Here below is a detailed agenda of AOSCC 2016, with time and specific event
information.

### Day 1: Reflections and discussions

Day 1 will be focused around reports and reflections of the past year and some
initial planning of the next. An estimated time table is presented below.

| Time         | Event information                                                                  |

During Day 1, reports and reflections will contain reviews of community
involvement, project achievements, and stuff that are more or less left behind
(and therefore should be taken care of in short order).

Planning and discussions are two other important component of Day 1, which will
consist of:

- Discussions: some features or new stuff are worth discussing over before the
real "do", so we will do that here.
- Votes/Polls:
  - Codename of next year's AOSC OS development.
  - Next year's default wallpaper for AOSC OS.
  - Next year's AOSCC location.

Following will be Junde Yhi's brief introduction to [T.B.D], and Xiaoxing Ye
hosting a lucky draw for licenses for CodeWeavers' CrossOver.

### Day 2: Knowledge worth sharing

If fun is your thing, Day 2 will certainly be your day. Day 2 has a strong
emphasis on sharing and clashing of ideas and knowledge. During the day, people
from around the community will come in with their prepared speeches, there might
just be your kind of thing inside!
