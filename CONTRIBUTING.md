Topic for Discussion
--------------------

File an issue, with some good outlines, and expected year-for-discussion.
Issue templates will be nice, hmm.

Make a directory for each year, e.g. `2015/` for AOSCC 2015, and `2016/` for AOSCC 2016.

----------------

Make an issue, and ask us to tag it with `april-fools` in the report.
